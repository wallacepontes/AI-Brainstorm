## Bitter Lesson idea

The "bitter lesson," formulated by Rich Sutton in 2019, states that general AI methods leveraging massive computation (search and learning) consistently outperform human-engineered, domain-specific techniques in the long run. It is considered "bitter" because it shows that AI researchers' efforts to build human knowledge into systems are ultimately less effective than scaling computation.

### Key Aspects of the Bitter Lesson:

- Computational Scaling Wins: Breakthrough progress in AI, such as in computer chess (Deep Blue), Go (AlphaGo), and computer vision, has consistently come from methods that leverage more computing power rather than specialized, pre-programmed knowledge.
- Initial Appeal vs. Long-Term Failure: Human-engineered knowledge often helps in the short term, but it plateaus and inhibits further progress in the long run.
- The "Bitter" Reality: The lesson is frustrating for researchers because it implies that human intuition and expertise are not the keys to creating artificial intelligence.
- Application Across Fields: The principle applies to various areas, including computer vision, speech recognition, and game playing.
- The Trend Toward Generalization: The AI field has shifted from hand-crafted features to deep learning models, which align with the principles of the bitter lesson.

Richard Sutton's "bitter lesson" in AI is that true intelligence comes from computation & general methods like search/learning, not mimicking human rules.
