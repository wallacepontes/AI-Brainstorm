Birgitta Böckeler explores how generative AI can help developers understand, rather than just generate, code. She uses an issue from the open-source hospital management system Bahmni to see how AI tools can assist in navigating and comprehending a large, legacy codebase. While AI tools provided some useful insights, they also struggled with certain tasks, particularly in setting up test environments and generating accurate unit tests. The experiment highlights both the potential and the limitations of AI in improving code comprehension.
