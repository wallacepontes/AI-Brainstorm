## [PartyRock](https://partyrock.aws/), an Amazon Bedrock Playground. 

PartyRock is a fun and intuitive hands-on, generative AI app-building playground. In just a few steps, you can create a variety of apps to experiment with generative AI. For example, you could build an app to generate dad jokes on a chosen topic, create the perfect personalized playlist, recommend what to serve based on ingredients in your pantry, analyze and optimize your party budget, or create an AI storyteller to guide your next fantasy role-playing campaign. By building and playing with PartyRock apps, you’ll learn the techniques and capabilities needed to take full advantage of generative AI, including experimenting with various foundation models, building intuition with text-based prompting, and chaining prompts together. PartyRock is powered by Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service that makes foundation models (FMs) from Amazon and leading AI companies available through an API.

PartyRock is built on the belief that all builders should have access to a fun and intuitive tool to get started building with generative AI and be able to share the apps they create to inspire others. You don’t need to know how to write a single line of code to start creating your own apps with PartyRock. Access to PartyRock is also straightforward through its web-based UI, which is separate from the AWS Management Console and does not require an AWS account. Using one-step tools, builders can share apps they’ve created using PartyRock with friends or publish links on their favorite social media using #partyrockplayground.

For a limited time, AWS offers new PartyRock users a free trial without the need to provide a credit card. Everyone can build AI apps with [PartyRock](https://partyrock.aws/).
