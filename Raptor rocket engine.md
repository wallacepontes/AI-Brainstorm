# Raptor rocket engine

## What is the Raptor sea level and Raptor vacuum?

The Raptor sea level and Raptor vacuum are two variants of the Raptor rocket engine developed by SpaceX. 

- **Raptor Sea Level (Raptor SL):** This variant is optimized for operation at sea level and is designed to produce maximum thrust in the atmosphere. It has a smaller nozzle compared to the vacuum variant, which is better suited for atmospheric pressure conditions. The sea-level version of the Raptor engine generates approximately 230 tons (about 510,000 pounds) of thrust.

- **Raptor Vacuum (Raptor Vac):** This variant is optimized for operation in the vacuum of space. It has a much larger nozzle to maximize efficiency in low-pressure conditions. The Raptor Vacuum engine generates more thrust in space compared to the sea-level version due to its optimized nozzle design. It produces about 250 tons (about 550,000 pounds) of thrust in a vacuum.

These engines are part of SpaceX's Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket, designed for missions to Mars, the Moon, and beyond.
