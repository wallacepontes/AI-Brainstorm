## 🛠️ How to Use This Library

* **Search:** Use your editor's "Global Search" to find specific architectural components (e.g., "RMSNorm").
* **Contribute:** Keep the `State of AI` and `Ecosystem` files updated as new models drop weekly.
* **Cross-Reference:** Many notes in `03_Architecture` link directly back to `01_Foundations` for the underlying math.

> "The goal is not to collect information, but to build a mental model that can predict the next token of the industry."
