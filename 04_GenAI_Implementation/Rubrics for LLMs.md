## Rubrics

Rubrics provide a flexible way to train LLMs on open-ended long-form answers where verifiable rewards are not applicable and human preferences provide coarse signals. Prior work shows that reinforcement learning with rubric-based rewards leads to consistent gains in LLM post-training.

Rubrics are structured scoring tools, often featuring criteria, performance levels (e.g., Expert, Proficient, Novice), and specific descriptors, used to evaluate assignments objectively. Effective types include analytical rubrics for detailed feedback, holistic rubrics for overall assessment, and single-point rubrics that focus on proficiency while allowing space for individualized, growth-oriented comments.

Here are various rubric ideas and types based on assessment needs:

### 1. Types of Rubrics

- Analytical Rubric: Breaks down assignments into components (e.g., content, organization, mechanics) and evaluates each separately.
- Holistic Rubric: Evaluates the overall quality of a student's work with one single score, suitable for quick, general assessments.
- Single-Point Rubric: Lists only the "proficient" criteria, leaving space for comments on how the work exceeds or needs improvement, which promotes personalized feedback.

### 2. Application-Based Rubric Ideas

- Project-Based Learning Rubric: Focuses on teamwork, research process, creativity, and final presentation, rather than just the end product.
- Presentation/Oral Rubric: Evaluates eye contact, clarity, engagement, and content knowledge.
- Writing/Paragraph Rubric: Assesses organization, grammar, topic sentences, and supporting details.
- Self-Assessment/Peer Review Rubric: A simplified version that helps students critically evaluate their own work or their peers' work. 

### 3. Key Components for Design

- Criteria/Traits: Define what is being assessed (e.g., "Critical Thinking," "Use of Evidence").
- Performance Levels: Use consistent, clear language (e.g., Exceeds, Meets, Approaches, Below).
- Descriptors: Detailed, measurable descriptions of what quality work looks like at each level. 

### 4. Best Practices

- Transparency: Share the rubric with students beforehand so they understand expectations.
- Focus on Feedback: Ensure the rubric provides actionable insights for improvement, not just a final grade.
- Keep it Simple: Avoid making the rubric too complex; it should enhance understanding, not cause confusion. 

For specific examples, you can look at the Pinterest ideas for writing rubrics, DePaul University’s types of rubrics, or North Carolina State University’s best practices for, examples and templates of rubrics.
